# Guess-the-number
This a basic python game that requires the user to guess a number between 0 and 20 and lets them know if the number chosen by them is less than or greater than the number chosen randomly by the program.
It is a self-teaching aid meant to learn the basics of binary search by observing the least number of steps taken to guess the correct number.
